# Project Details

This is a demo website of Motorcycle and Accessories [Motoscape Live Site](https://motoscape-16.web.app).

## Libraries and frameworks

This is a react-based single page website.

React router, context api and tanstack react query was used here. Firebase was used for authentication. MongoDB is used as the database.

tailwind and flowbite-react was used for styling. 

## Key Features -

* This website has a navbar, a home page, motorcycles and accessories shopping page. A user can browse the items, see the details and place order. In the Navbar there is a route called Dashboard - where a user can add a review and see his orders. A user can also cancel his order(s).

* The dashboard for an admin is different. In an admin's dashboard, he will see options like "manage orders", "manage motorcycles", "manage accessories", "Add a motorcycle", "Add an accessory", "manage users".

* An admin can change the status of an order from "Pending" to "Shipped". He can also delete any order.

* An admin can add or delete any motorcycle and accessory.

* An admin can make any user an admin.

#### *for testing purpose, I have added an admin with the email admin@admin.com, the password is 123456*

### The purchase, book a test ride and learning program details will be added in the future.

### some of the Admin components are not responsive. It was done deliberately, because an admin should have access to many properties of a data and he should modify the data from a computer, not a mobile device.
